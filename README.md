COSC 3380 Databases Project
Theme Park Management System and Web Application

I created several issues in the issue tracker
Please select one and leave a comment to indicate that you are working on it
After you've chosen one the create a feature branch for it
When you finish the feature merge it back with develop
We will merge with master, build and deploy v1.0 of our site once all issues have been completed

ALSO I'm letting you know that creating the test data is top priority because so many of the other features
rely on it so someone need to get that done
